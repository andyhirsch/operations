Plugins / Content Elements
==========================

There are different plugins for different views.
Depending on used plugin you have different settings directly in the plugin.

.. tip::

   You find description for those settings below the field title in the plugin.

Those setting can also be set by using TypoScript but settings in the plugin always
overrides those settings in TypoScript.

.. tip::

   With that behaviour it's possible to set default settings in TypoScript
   and override it in a Plugin for some pages, if necessary.
