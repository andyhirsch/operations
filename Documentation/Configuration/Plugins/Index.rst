Plugins / Content Elements
==========================

There are different content elements for different views.
Depending on used content element you have different settings in the tab
"Plugin".

.. tip::

   You find description for those settings below the field title.

Those setting can also be set by using TypoScript but settings in the content
element always overrides those settings from TypoScript.

.. tip::

   With that behaviour it's possible to set default settings in TypoScript
   and override it in a Plugin for some pages, if necessary.
