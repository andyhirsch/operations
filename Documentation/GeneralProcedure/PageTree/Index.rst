Suggested Page Tree
===================

Here is an example page tree for a firefighter website.
This is just a proposal for you and can be different to your site. I suggest at least a sysfolder for the data,
and pages for list and single views for the things you need.

The news folder in my screen is just there in my develop environment and is not needed for `operations`.

You should create the page tree before start to configure the TypoScript settings. Often you need uids from pages
they are important for the configuration.

.. note::

   The pages for the single views should be hidden in menu. You can set this in the page properties
   with and disable the switch "Page enabled in menus".
